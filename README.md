# Arivoli – AI Counselor System

Arivoli is an AI-assisted counseling and guidance system designed to
support students through compassionate, context-aware responses.
The system is built to align with educational environments and
curriculum needs rather than generic conversational AI use.

## Purpose

- To provide students with empathetic guidance and academic support

## System Overview

Arivoli uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** approach, enabling
responses that are grounded in curated educational and contextual data.
This allows the system to remain relevant, controlled, and aligned with
institutional requirements.
